# General Best Practices

## Development Philosophy

1. **Start Small**: Only include most important features initially
2. **Keep it Simple**: Avoid complex features and premature optimization
3. **Fail Fast**: Use proper error handling but identify weak points quickly
4. **Log Everything**: Add logging throughout for debugging
5. **Test Critical Paths**: Write tests for core functionality

## Data Design

- **Remove Data Redundancy**: Don't store same data; use references or foreign keys
- **Design Schema First**: Decide data structure or DB schema first based on app requirements
- **Separation of Concerns**: Separate Data Schema from Business Logic
- **Normalization**: For databases, follow normalization principles (but don't over-normalize)

## Code Organization

- **Modular Design**: Break code into logical modules/components
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function/component should do one thing well
- **DRY Principle**: Don't Repeat Yourself - extract common patterns
- **Naming Conventions**: Use clear, descriptive names following language conventions

## Error Handling

- **Graceful Degradation**: Handle errors gracefully when possible
- **Logging**: Log errors with context for debugging
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Provide meaningful error messages to users
- **Retry Logic**: Implement retry logic for transient failures

## Performance

- **Measure First**: Profile before optimizing
- **Cache Wisely**: Use caching where it makes sense
- **Lazy Loading**: Load resources when needed
- **Batch Operations**: Group similar operations when possible

## Security

- **Never Trust Input**: Validate and sanitize all inputs
- **Use Environment Variables**: Store secrets in environment variables, never in code
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
- **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update dependencies for security patches

## Documentation

- **Code Comments**: Comment complex logic and business rules
- **API Documentation**: Document APIs clearly
- **README**: Keep README up to date with setup and usage instructions
- **Architecture Docs**: Document high-level architecture and design decisions
