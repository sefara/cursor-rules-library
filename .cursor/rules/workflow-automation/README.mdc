# Workflow Automation Rules

Rules for building automated workflows using n8n, ActivePieces, and similar tools.

## Files

- **[n8n.mdc](./n8n.mdc)** - n8n-specific best practices and patterns
- **[activepieces.mdc](./activepieces.mdc)** - ActivePieces-specific guidance
- **[patterns.mdc](./patterns.mdc)** - Universal workflow patterns applicable to all tools

## Common Principles

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic workflows, add complexity gradually
2. **Error Handling**: Always include error handling for external calls
3. **Testing**: Test with sample data before production
4. **Documentation**: Document workflow purpose and data structures
5. **Security**: Never hardcode credentials, use environment variables

## Quick Reference

### Common Patterns
- **Linear**: Simple sequential processing
- **Conditional**: Different paths based on conditions
- **Parallel**: Concurrent independent operations
- **Loop**: Process items in batches
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful failure handling
- **Retry**: Automatic retry on transient failures

### Data Management
- Validate data at entry points
- Transform data shape early
- Use variables for complex data structures
- Pass only necessary data between nodes
